# About Me

Hi! I am Xianquan Yan, preferred name being Sarinstein. I am currently embarked on a journey as a first-year Ph.D. candidate at the National University of Singapore, where I am fortunate to be guided by super-supportive supervisors, [LEE Ching Hua] from the Department of Physics, and [Kenji Kawaguchi] from the Department of Computer Science.

My academic pursuits are fueled by a fervent curiosity about the world and its intricate networks. Presently, my research is situated at the intersection of **Complex Networks and Nonlinear Dynamics** (including social and neural phenomena), **AI for Physics** (and potentially Physics for AI), and **Non-Hermition Physics**. Beyond the realm of science, I am deeply captivated by philosophy, economics, and psychology, and aspire to explore the complex nature of these disciplines in the future.

P.S. "Sarinstein" was coined in inspiration of intellectual giants Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Einstein.
