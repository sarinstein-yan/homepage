# About Me

Hi! I'm a first-year Ph.D. (23-intake, Fall) at National University of Singapore (Department of Physic, Supervised by [LEE Ching Hua]; and Department of Computer Science, Supervised by [Kenji Kawaguchi]).

I'm interested in a range of topics, mostly and currently in the intersection of: *Complex Networks and Nonlinear Dynamics* (including social and neural phenomena); *AI for Physics* (and potentially Physics for AI); *Non-Hermition Physics*. Moreover, I love to read philosophy, economics, and psychology; wish to study the complex nature in these disciplines in the future.

Thanks the support of my dearest love, I'm able to pursue my dream in the field of physics and computer science exempt of future worries.
